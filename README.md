## Deck:
It consists 48 cards:
We using three Boolean operators *AND*, *OR*, and *XOR*
1. 8 *OR* cards resolving to 1
2. 8 *OR* cards resolving to 0
3. 8 *AND* cards resolving to 1
4. 8 *AND* cards resolving to 0
5. 8 *XOR* cards resolving to 1
6. 8 *XOR* cards resolving to 0

## Rules ‚ùï
---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------

```diff 
Starting with a line of Initial Binary cards laid perpendicular to two facing players,
the object of the game is to be the first to complete a logical pyramid whose final output
equals that of the rightmost Initial Binary card facing that player.

The game is played in ‚Äúdraw one play one‚Äù format. The pyramid consists of decreasing rows of gate cards,
where the outputs of any contiguous pair of cards comprise the input values to a single card in the following row.
The pyramid, therefore, has Initial Binary values as its base and tapers to a single card closest to the player.
By tracing the ‚Äúflow‚Äù of values through any series of gate, every card placed in the pyramid must make ‚Äúlogical sense‚Äù,
i.e. the inputs and output value of every gate card must conform to the rule of that gate card.

Since both players' pyramids share the Initial Binary cards as a base, ‚Äúflipping‚Äù an Initial Binary has an
effect on both players' pyramids.A principal strategy during game play is to invalidate gate cards in the opponent's
logic pyramid while rendering as little damage to one‚Äôs own pyramid in the process.

Some logic gates are more robust than others to a change to their inputs. 
Therefore, not all logic gate cards have the same strategic value.

The standard edition of the game does not contain NAND, NOR, or XNOR gates. It is possible,
therefore, for a player to arrive at an unresolvable pair of inputs.
